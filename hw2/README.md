# Web application
In computing, a web application or web app is a client–server computer program which the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a web browser. Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, and online auction.

Web sites most likely to be referred to as "web applications" are those which have similar functionality to a desktop software application, or to a mobile app. HTML5 introduced explicit language support for making applications that are loaded as web pages, but can store data locally and continue to function while offline.

Single-page applications are more application-like because they reject the more typical web paradigm of moving between distinct pages with different URLs. Single-page frameworks like Sencha Touch and AngularJS might be used to speed development of such a web app for a mobile platform.

# Native App
Native App是一种基于智能手机本地操作系统如iOS、Android、WP并使用原生程式编写运行的第三方应用程序，也叫本地app。一般使用的开发语言为JAVA、C++、Objective-C。
## 概述
自iOS和Android这两个的手机操作系统发布以来，在互联网界从此就多了一个新的名词：App（意为运行在智能的移动终端设备第三方应用程序）。

开发者们都知道在高端智能手机系统中有两种应用程序：一种是基于本地（操作系统）运行的APP；一种是基于高端机的浏览器运行的Web App。

Native App因为位于平台层上方，向下访问和兼容的能力会比较好一些，可以支持在线或离线，消息推送或本地资源访问，摄像拨号功能的调取。但是由于设备碎片化，App的开发成本要高很多，维持多个版本的更新升级比较麻烦，用户的安装门槛也比较高。但是比较乐观的是，AppStore培养了一种比较好的用户付费模式，所以在Apple的生态圈里，开发者的盈利模式是一种明朗状态，其他market也在往这条路上靠拢。
### 优势
1. 提供最佳的用户体验，最优质的用户界面，最华丽的交互
2. 针对不同平台提供不同体验
3. 可节省带宽成本
4. 可访问本地资源
5. 盈利模式明朗
6. 打开速度更快
### 劣势
1. 移植到不同平台上比较麻烦
2. 维持多个版本的成本比较高
3. 需要通过store或market的确认
4. 盈利需要与第三方分成
5. 开发的成本比较大
## 发展现状
根据百度2013年Q1发布的《移动互联网发展趋势报告》显示，在全行业的移动浪潮中，Native App开发者遇到前所未有的挑战。Native APP遇到的三大困境:1、虽然用户手机里的Native APP数量在增多，但日均启动个数却在减少；2、用户的使用时长不断向高频Native APP集中，加剧了头部效应；3、对于低频和不知名的Native App，则面临着更严峻的“分发”和“使用”长尾困境。这三大困境对开发者形成了较大的挑战。

其中，大部分低频和不知名Native App在应用商店少人问津，无法到达用户手机。数据显示，应用商店下载量最大的前1000个（数量占比不足0.1%）App，占据了总下载次数的一半以上。这说明用户在下载应用时“马太效应”明显。困境同样也体现在应用使用率上，用户下载之后极少使用，要用时却想不起或找不到它，甚至是六成的Native APP被下载安装后一周内并未被使用，其中又有约1/3在一个月内都未被使用，逐渐成为“僵尸应用”。
## Native vs. web apps
A web app is an application that the user does not download and instead accesses via a web browser over a network. Example web browsers include Google Chrome, Safari and Mozilla Firefox. Web apps provide functionality from bank account access to YouTube video viewing via, for example, Safari on an iPhone.

While native apps are written to the specific device, a majority of web applications can be written in JavaScript, CSS and the standard version of HTML for universal use across various browsers. Web apps can use a single code base because they are not designed around a specific device. Web apps are fast and simple to build, but are not as versatile and quick as native apps.

## Native vs. hybrid apps
Hybrid applications are a combination of native and web apps. The inner workings of a hybrid application are similar to a web app, but it installs like a native app. Hybrid applications have access to internal device APIs, which means they can use resources such as the camera, storage and GPS. Yelp and Instagram are examples of hybrid apps.

Hybrid applications are built with HTML and CSS. Developers create one code base, then make small changes to tailor the app to each platform. Fewer developers are dedicated to each platform with a hybrid app than with a fully native app. Hybrid apps typically run a web app through a container or WebView, a browser that can be contained inside of a mobile app.

Hybrid applications perform differently than native apps in several ways. Hybrid applications are based on web apps and contain the same navigational elements as web applications. Additionally, there is no offline mode for a hybrid application -- it only works with an internet connection. Native apps, by contrast, can operate offline.

Cost differences between native and hybrid applications are minimal. In both application types, developers must write code to launch on multiple platforms. In general, if the development time of an application is less than four to six months, a hybrid application is preferable, as you can construct them faster.

# Hybrid App
Hybrid apps embed a mobile web site inside a native app, possibly using a hybrid framework like Apache Cordova and Ionic or Appcelerator Titanium. This allows development using web technologies (and possibly directly copying code from an existing mobile web site) while also retaining certain advantages of native apps (e.g. direct access to device hardware, offline operation, app store visibility).
